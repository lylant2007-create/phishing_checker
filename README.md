##  How to Run the Application

Since this project requires external libraries and custom assets (images), please follow these steps to run the GUI on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have **Python 3.x** installed. You will also need the Pillow library to handle the background images.

1.  **Download the project files:**
    * Download the `phishing_check_cute_version.py` script.
    * Download the two image assets: `main_background.png` and `popup_background.png`.
    * Place all three files in the same folder.

2.  **Install the necessary library (Pillow):**
    Open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command to install the required library:

    ```bash
    pip install Pillow
    ```

### Running the GUI

Once the prerequisites are installed, you can launch the application directly from your terminal:

1.  Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
2.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python phishing_check_cute_version.py
    ```

The Pixel Art GUI window will open, allowing you to enter URLs and check for phishing signs!
